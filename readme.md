## Thank you!
Thank you, *thank you*, ***thank you*** for checking out my Discord.JS template. I decided that I'd put it together after helping a friend learn Discord.JS and possibly help many others! 

This template may be copied, forked, or redistributed as long credit is given back to me, it can be a simple, "Thank you to..." or a link leading back to my GitHub Account.

## Getting Started
1. You'll need to clone the repository, this can be done with source control managers such as Git. In order to clone this repo in specific, you can open your terminal and run the following. This will then copy the contents of the repository into your current folder under the name `discordjs-starter`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LavenderFoxxo/discordjs-starter.git
```

2. You'll need to install the dependencies required in order to execute the code. It's as simple as running an install command. It can vary for each package manager though. In this example, I'll be using a common one, npm.

```bash
npm install
```

3. After this, you'll need to open up `.env.example` copy it to `.env` and fill in the respective values. There is a link to a guide by Discord that shows how to obtain the stuff needed.

4. Once you've completed the steps above, all you need to do is run the following and you're done!

```bash
node index.js
```

5. Have fun and experiment! This template was designed to allow you to turn this template into something big, you never know what might happen.
